#### By _Qian Li_ üòä

#### This is my forth project which demonstrates uses of test-driven development, understanding of constructors and prototypes. 

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* VS code

## Description

It will serve as a website for a pizza company where a user can choose one or more individual toppings (green pepper, cheese, etc.), a size to order a pizza, and see the final cost.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Open the project folder(pizza-parlor).
* Open the index.html on the Chrome broswer.

## Tests

  const myPizza = new Pizza(1, 2, 'order1', 1);
  Expected Output: Pizza¬†{toppings: 1, size: 2, name: 'order1', 1}

Describe: Pizza.prototype.countName()

  test: "It should  checks if object name is less than 4 letters long, and if so changes this name to equal "invalid name"."
  Code:
  const myPizza = new Pizza(1, 2, 'ord', 1);
  myPizza.prototype.countName()
  Expected Output: "invalid name"
  
Describe: Pizza.prototype.addPrice()

  Code:
  const myPizza = new Pizza(1, 2, 'order1', 1);

Describe: Pizza.prototype.addPrice()

  test: "It should add $100 if the user does not select a size."
